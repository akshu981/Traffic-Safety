    "text": "1 Introduction\nMotor vehicle accidents (falling under unintentional injuries) was the third major factor of death after Cancer and Heart Disease in the United States in 2023. We chose this topic because traffic fatality is one of the most critical issue that needs to be addressed and further researched upon. Although our primary goal is to uncover facts using exploratory data analysis, we also aim to pick a stance and create awareness on the importance of implementing robust traffic safety regulation and policies based on that stance. Some of the keys questions that we want to answer are:\n\nHow has the number of fatal crashes changed over the years?\nWhat type of fatal crashes happen the most?\nWhat factors contribute to the total fatal crashes?\n\nSource",

The data are collected by NHTSA in collaboration with state and local law enforcement agencies, and include details on motor vehicle traffic crashes, traffic crash fatalities, and other national statistics. The data is available is txt and xls format, and is updated annually with the latest data being from 2022. There are different sets of data including summary, trends, crashes, vehicles, people, and states. We used the summary dataset which had data for all of United States from 1994 to 2022. There are 19 rows (variables) and 31 columns (years). We plan to import the data into Rstudio using the xls format. The exact dataset used can be accessed and downloaded at https://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx. The dataset, cleaned and uncleaned, can also be found in our Data folder. In this folder, we also have a script that can clean the uncleaned dataset.",

The data distribution for drivers is bimodal with two peaks corresponding to years 2002 and 2021. For passengers, it is unimodal with roghly positively skewed. Further, there are no significant outliers in the data distribution above. The above graph omits the count of “Unknown” since the count for that category is small compared to passengers and drivers.\nOne more key oberservation is that for all years, the number of drivers involved in vehicle crash is higher than the number of passengers involved in a crash.
