# Introduction

Motor vehicle accidents (falling under unintentional injuries) was the third major factor of death after Cancer and Heart Disease in the United States in 2023. We chose this topic because traffic fatality is one of the most critical issue that needs to be addressed and further researched upon. Although our primary goal is to uncover facts using exploratory data analysis, we also aim to pick a stance and create awareness on the importance of implementing robust traffic safety regulation and policies based on that stance. Some of the keys questions that we want to answer are: 

1. How has the number of fatal crashes changed over the years? 
2. What type of fatal crashes happen the most?
3. What factors contribute to the total fatal crashes?
