Project Description: For this project, we will be using the dataset provided by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to analyze vehicle crashes and type of fatalities every year. The goal of this project is to ultimately answer key questions and gain insights for facilitating traffic safety across the nation. The dataset has records of the registered and unregistered vehicles, licensed and unlicensed drivers per year, which would be a baseline for deeper analysis in our project.
